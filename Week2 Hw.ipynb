Due to how easy and efficient it was to get information from ChatGPT, I found myself quite satisfied and not in the least frustrated with the responses of the chatbot. Based on my experiences so far with ChatGPT in helping me learn, understand and write code, I believe that I am able to make a positive assessment of Chatbots to be beneficial tools in my learning journey to understand code."

I do believe that my initial perception was one of skepticism and doubt, as I had always been taught that you are taught things by actual people (either teachers or even on YouTube) or by literary resources such as textbooks, but after having used ChatGPT recently in this course, I am starting to develop a more positive perception in which I derive a certain utility from how AI-driven tools are able to help me in much more specific, individualised manners than traditional forms of learning (such as textbooks) in such a beneficial way."
